# IQueryable IEnumerable Comparison

In C#, **`IQueryable`** and **`IEnumerable`** are both interfaces that represent collections of objects, but they are used in different scenarios and have different capabilities.

## IEnumerable:

1. **`Definition`**: **`IEnumerable`** is the simplest form of collection interface. It represents a forward-only cursor of data. It is part of the **`System.Collections`** namespace.

2. **`Usage`**: It is suitable for in-memory collections such as arrays, lists, or any other type of collection where you want to iterate through the elements.

3. **`Execution`**: Operations on **`IEnumerable`** are performed in-memory, meaning that if you apply any LINQ query on an **`IEnumerable`**, the entire collection is loaded into memory, and the query is executed on the client side.

4. **`Lazy Loading`**: It does not support lazy loading. All the data is loaded into memory before any operation is performed.

## IQueryable:

1. **`Definition`**: **`IQueryable`** is a more powerful and flexible interface, and it inherits from IEnumerable. It is part of the **`System.Linq`** namespace.

2. **`Usage`**: It is suitable for querying data from external data sources such as databases (e.g., Entity Framework). **`IQueryable`** allows you to build queries that are executed on the server side, which can lead to more efficient data retrieval.

3. **`Execution`**: Operations on **`IQueryable`** are usually executed on the server side (e.g., in the database), allowing for more efficient query execution.

4. **`Lazy Loading`**: It supports lazy loading. Queries are not executed until the data is actually needed, which can result in better performance when dealing with large datasets.

## Summary:
* Use **`IEnumerable`** for in-memory collections when you want to work with objects in memory, and the data is relatively small.
* Use **`IQueryable`** when working with external data sources or when dealing with large datasets, as it allows for more efficient querying and supports lazy loading.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the difference:

```csharp
// Using IEnumerable
IEnumerable<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
var resultIEnumerable = numbers.Where(x => x > 2).ToList();

// Using IQueryable (e.g., with Entity Framework)
IQueryable<int> numbersQuery = dbContext.Numbers; // Assuming dbContext.Numbers is an IQueryable source
var resultIQueryable = numbersQuery.Where(x => x > 2).ToList();
```

In the **`IEnumerable`** example, the entire collection is loaded into memory before applying the **`Where`** filter. In the **`IQueryable`** example, the query is constructed and executed on the database server, and only the filtered results are brought into memory.
